# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design
A complete portfolio of my CS255 System Analysis and Design work, including Business Requirements Documents, UML diagrams, activity diagrams, and scheduling artifacts for the DriverPass case study.

**CS255 System Analysis and Design

DriverPass Project Portfolio**

This repository contains the complete set of system analysis and design artifacts I created while completing CS255: System Analysis and Design at Southern New Hampshire University. The project focuses on designing a proposed web-based scheduling and training system for a company called DriverPass.

The work completed in this course demonstrates the core competencies of a systems analyst, including requirements gathering, use case modeling, activity modeling, and structured documentation aligned with industry standards.

📘 Project Summary

DriverPass is a company that provides driver training, online practice tests, and on-the-road lesson scheduling. My analysis included:

Identifying all system actors

Gathering functional and nonfunctional requirements

Creating UML use case diagrams

Creating activity and sequence diagrams

Mapping dependencies and time requirements using a Gantt chart

Designing structured Business Requirements Documents (BRDs)

All work strictly follows APA 7 expectations, properly articulated abbreviations, and clearly separated purpose, background, goals, and objectives.
