**CS255 System Analysis and Design

DriverPass Project Portfolio**

This repository showcases the complete set of system analysis and design artifacts I created for CS255: System Analysis and Design at Southern New Hampshire University. The course centered on analyzing and documenting the proposed system for DriverPass, a company that provides driver training, scheduling, and online practice test services.

The work in this repository demonstrates the foundational responsibilities of a systems analyst, including requirements collection, UML modeling, structured documentation, and translating stakeholder interviews into precise system artifacts.

📘 Project Overview

The DriverPass project required designing a secure, cloud-based system that allows customers to:

Create accounts and manage personal information

Purchase driving lesson packages

Schedule, modify, and cancel driving lessons

Access online practice tests and track progress

Interact with office staff, instructors, and system administrators

The system also integrates with external services, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for updated policies and the notification service for confirmations.

This repository captures each step of that analysis process.

📁 Repository Contents
1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)

A structured BRD including:

High-level system purpose

Detailed system background

Clearly separated goals and measurable objectives

Functional and nonfunctional requirements

User interface requirements

Assumptions and limitations

Project schedule with dependencies

All abbreviations are articulated before use, and APA 7 standards are followed where citations appear.

2. UML Diagrams

A complete set of diagrams representing system behavior and structure:

Use Case Diagram

Activity Diagram for Schedule Driving Lesson

Sequence Diagrams

Process and Object Modeling Artifacts

These diagrams use correct relationships, system boundaries, and actor roles based on the DriverPass interview transcript.

3. Project Scheduling

Gantt chart with defined timelines

Task dependencies

Team roles and workflow planning

This section reflects how analysts coordinate system development tasks from requirements gathering through system delivery.

4. System Models and Documentation

Documentation that explains:

How process and object models apply to this scenario

Advantages and limitations of each modeling approach

How different diagrams support system understanding

5. Learning Reflection

A summary of key skills and insights gained throughout CS255, including:

Translating stakeholder interviews into system requirements

Distinguishing goals from measurable objectives

Writing clear, grounded system documentation

Avoiding speculative features or unjustified assumptions

Applying UML modeling techniques accurately

💡 Key Skills Demonstrated

Requirements analysis

UML modeling (use case, activity, sequence diagrams)

Structured business documentation

System scheduling and dependency mapping

Clear, scholarly technical communication

Identification of actors, data sources, and sinks
